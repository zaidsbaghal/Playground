# Playground
This is a repository I use for learning, trying out new things and experimenting. 

There are folders that contain code from classes I have taken and there are folders that contain small and simple projects that I am playing around with. 

Some of the projects may be moved into individual repositories if I feel they have a lot of growth potential. 

Feel free to look around but none of this is meant to be used by anyone.
